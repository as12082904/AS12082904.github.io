# About Me
Hello! I am AS.
I like to hang out with friends and family, and I enjoy working out. One of my goals is to one day become a Neurosurgeon. Another one is to be stable financially. Finally, a goal of mine is to be happy in life. My greatest skills is being a hardworker, being persistent, and being compassionate about my works.
